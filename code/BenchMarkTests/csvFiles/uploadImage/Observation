### Observations from the Stress Test

**For 30 Concurrent Users:**
- **Mean Response Time (ms):** 2331.58
- **Max Response Time (ms):** 12615
- **Min Response Time (ms):** 784
- **Standard Deviation (ms):** 2193.75
- **Total Requests:** 26

**Observations:**
- The system handled 30 concurrent users with a mean response time of approximately 2.3 seconds.
- The response times varied significantly, as indicated by the large standard deviation (2193.75 ms), with the maximum response time reaching over 12 seconds.
- This level of variability suggests potential bottlenecks or issues under load.

**For 50 Concurrent Users:**
- **Mean Response Time (ms):** 3041.67
- **Max Response Time (ms):** 14679
- **Min Response Time (ms):** 1280
- **Standard Deviation (ms):** 2049.83
- **Total Requests:** 43

**Observations:**
- With an increase to 50 concurrent users, the mean response time increased to around 3 seconds, indicating a moderate rise in latency.
- The max response time also increased to approximately 14.7 seconds, and the standard deviation remained high, showing continued variability in response times.
- The system managed to handle more requests, but the higher max response time suggests additional strain.

**For 100 Concurrent Users:**
- **Mean Response Time (ms):** 6063.60
- **Max Response Time (ms):** 22514
- **Min Response Time (ms):** 1727
- **Standard Deviation (ms):** 3151.03
- **Total Requests:** 89

**Observations:**
- Doubling the concurrent users to 100 led to a significant increase in mean response time to over 6 seconds.
- The maximum response time increased to more than 22 seconds, indicating severe performance degradation.
- The standard deviation also increased, showing more inconsistency in response times, which may impact user experience.

**For 200 Concurrent Users:**
- **Mean Response Time (ms):** 13018.71
- **Max Response Time (ms):** 41333
- **Min Response Time (ms):** 3368
- **Standard Deviation (ms):** 7183.59
- **Total Requests:** 180

**Observations:**
- At 200 concurrent users, the mean response time rose dramatically to over 13 seconds, suggesting that the system is under substantial stress.
- The maximum response time reached an alarming 41 seconds, which is far from acceptable for a responsive user experience.
- The high standard deviation (7183.59 ms) reflects extreme variability, which could be due to server or network limitations, or inefficiencies in handling high loads.

### General Observations and Recommendations:

1. **Scalability Concerns:** As the number of concurrent users increased, the system's performance degraded significantly. This trend suggests that the current system may not be well-optimized for handling higher loads.

2. **High Variability in Response Times:** The large standard deviations across all tests indicate inconsistent performance. This inconsistency can lead to unpredictable user experiences, with some users experiencing significantly longer load times than others.

3. **Potential Bottlenecks:** The increase in response times with concurrent users suggests possible bottlenecks in the system, such as CPU, memory, database throughput, or inefficient code paths.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - **Load Testing and Optimization:** Further testing should be conducted to identify specific bottlenecks. Profiling tools can help pinpoint slow parts of the system.
   - **Scalability Improvements:** Consider implementing load balancing, database optimization, and possibly scaling out the infrastructure (e.g., more servers) to handle higher traffic volumes.
   - **Code and Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries, use caching where appropriate, and ensure efficient code practices to reduce response times.
   - **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring to track system performance and automatically alert when response times exceed acceptable thresholds.
